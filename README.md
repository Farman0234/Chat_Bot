# Chat_Bot
ðŸ¤– Input Only Chatbot This is a simple yet interactive chatbot built using HTML and JavaScript. The chatbot responds to specific user inputs such as greetings, questions about JavaScript learning, and other common phrases. It simulates a conversation with an intelligent bot using basic string matching and provides helpful responses.  Features: User Interaction: The user can type messages and the bot responds accordingly.  Bot Typing Simulation: The bot simulates typing before responding to give a more human-like interaction.  Chat History: The chat history is stored in sessionStorage to persist even after a page refresh.  Responsive Design: The chatbot is designed to be user-friendly and responsive, adjusting to different screen sizes.  Simple Natural Language Processing: The bot can understand and respond to a set of predefined inputs such as greetings, questions about JavaScript, and more.  How It Works: The user types a message in the input field and presses the Enter key.  The bot checks the input against a set of predefined responses.  If the input matches a keyword (e.g., "hello" or "how are you"), the bot responds with a relevant message.  If the bot doesn't understand the input, it prompts the user to rephrase the message.  Tech Stack: HTML: For the structure of the chatbot.  JavaScript: For handling user input, generating responses, and managing chat history.  CSS (Inline Styling): For basic styling and layout of the chat interface.  Setup: Clone the repository to your local machine.  Open index.html in your browser.  Start chatting with the bot!  Screenshots:  Future Enhancements: Use Regular Expressions (Regex) for more advanced input handling.  Integrate natural language processing (NLP) libraries to make the bot more intelligent.  Add support for user authentication and personalization.  Expand the bot's knowledge base to handle a wider variety of inputs.
